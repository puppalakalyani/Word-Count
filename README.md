## Word Counter Application

### Features
- Upload and read text files
- Count total words
- Count total characters
- Simple and intuitive user interface

### How to Use
1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Click "Choose File"
3. Select a text file
4. Click "Count Words and Characters"
5. View the word and character count

### Technical Implementation
- HTML5 file input
- JavaScript FileReader API
- Simple word counting algorithm
- Responsive CSS styling

## Development Journey

### Initial Setup
- Created project structure with technology-specific folders
- Initialized Git repository
- Added boilerplate files for each technology

### Word Counter Development
- Created HTML interface
- Implemented JavaScript word counting logic
- Added CSS for styling
- Created a sample text file for testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Python 3.x
- Node.js
- Web Browser

### Running the Projects

#### Java
```bash
cd Java
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
Expected Output: `Hello, Java Interns!`

#### Python
```bash
cd Python
python3 hello_world.py
```
Expected Output: `Hello, Python Interns!`

#### Web Development
Open `WebDevelopment/index.html` in a web browser

#### Frontend Development
```bash
cd FrontendDevelopment
node app.js
```
Expected Output: `Hello, Frontend Development Interns!`

#### Word Counter
1. Use Python's HTTP server to run the application
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser

## Sample Text
A sample text file `sample_text.txt` is included to demonstrate the word counting functionality.

## Git Repository
- Repository initialized
- Initial commit created with boilerplate content
- All files staged and committed

## Next Steps for Interns
1. Explore the starter files in each technology folder
2. Modify and expand the existing code
3. Add more complex examples
4. Practice version control with Git

## Next Steps
- Enhance word counter with additional features
- Add error handling
- Implement more advanced text analysis
